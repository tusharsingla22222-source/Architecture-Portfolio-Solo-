              The Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris is a landmark cultural
              complex, known for its "inside-out" architectural design, which

              music creation, cinemas, and theaters. The building's unique
              design by architects Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers was completed
              in 1977 and has become a major tourist attraction.

              The term "New York Times Building, labour" can refer to two

              building's construction, or the labor issues at the New York Times
              Company itself. The original, 2007 construction involved
              developers and a main contractor, AMEC Construction Management,
              but no specific labor details from that period are provided in the
              search results. The other interpretation relates to the current

              around 4,000 of Klee's works, alongside rotating exhibitions.

              Vulcano Buono is a shopping and leisure center in Nola, Italy,
              designed by architect Renzo Piano to resemble a "good volcano". It
              features a large, circular shopping mall with numerous stores,
              restaurants, a multiplex cinema, and a hotel, all contained within
              a building that looks like a truncated volcano. The center is
              designed as a modern take on an ancient Greek marketplace, with a
              large, open-air "crater" in the middle for events and public
              gathering spaces.

              The building's architecture mimics a truncated cone, with a green,
              planted roof that slopes up to the rim, designed to blend into the
              landscape.
