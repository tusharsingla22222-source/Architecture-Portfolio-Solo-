              Casa Batll칩 is a renowned architectural landmark in Barcelona,
              Spain, designed by Antoni Gaud칤. Originally a 19th-century
              building, Gaud칤 completely renovated it between 1904 and 1906 for
              industrialist Josep Batll칩, transforming the exterior and interior
              with a style inspired by nature, often interpreted as the legend
              of St. George. Key features include a bone-like facade, an arched,
              dragon-scaled roof, and a light well with blue-hued tiles to
              maximize natural light.
